# AI Debate with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a custom multi-agent debate environment using the PettingZoo library and trains agents using Ray's RLlib. The environment is designed for structured tasks where agents can argue persuasively or logically.

## Features
- Custom debate environment (`DebateEnv`) with two agents.
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning using PPO.
- Configurable environment and reward structures.
